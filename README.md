# 0 - Introduction

This C++ code is an improvement over the previous C++ code Nbody.cpp. Outside of making the code object oriented, this code implements an octree structure to organize all the bodies in the simulation, allowing for some approximations that vastly cut down on the run time. The Velocity-Verlet algorithm is still used, as well as Newtonian gravity and elastic collision detection. Thanks to massive improvements in memory usage however, this code is capable of handling hundreds or thousands of bodies over tens or hundreds of thousands of timesteps, with a runtime on order of a few seconds to an hour. The Barnes-Hut Octree structure and approximations implemented additionally allows for the runtime to scale as O(NlogN) as opposed to O(N^2).

This code is fully object oriented. There are several classes and one struct declated (which will be elaborated on further down) but the entire simulation is run within the bodygen object. The user-accessible main.cpp file only allows the user to run the simulation given a set of command line inputs. 

This code is split into a header .hpp file and two .cpp files: bodygen.hpp, bodygen.cpp, main.cpp
  
  - bodygen.hpp contains all the classes and structs, as well as all the function declarations within the classes
  - bodygen.cpp contains all the function definitions, as well as various operator overloads
  - main.cpp takes in command line inputs, checks for the correct inputs, and runs the simulation based on those inputs

# 1 - The Barnes-Hut Algorithm
The primary innovation of this code is the implementation of the Barnes-Hut Algorithm. For small scale simulations this does not provide many advantages, but for a large number of bodies, this algorithm is highly efficient in cutting down run time while still producing relatively accurate results.

## 1.1 - The Octree Structure
The data structure to implement the algorithm comes in the form of a tree. The simulation space is divided into eight quadrants, with each of the eight quadrants then being subdivided further into eight subquadrants. This would then repeat recursively. Each quadrant or region can be considered a node that has eight branches, which are connected to the eight subregions or subquadrants, which themselves are nodes.

Suppose the simulation space is populated with a distribution of bodies. The Octree is created recursively such that there will be one body per leaf node. The attached image provides a simplified 2D version with a few bodies, but it can be generalized to 3D with many more bodies

You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

> publishable as-is, as plain text, without

> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

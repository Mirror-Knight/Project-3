\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classbody}{body}} \\*Body class that stores the information of a body -\/ position, velocity, acceleration, mass, and radius. Index keeps track of the body in updating \char`\"{}bodyvector\char`\"{} (in another class), and newacceleration is needed in Velocity-\/\+Verlet }{\pageref{classbody}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classbodygen}{bodygen}} \\*The main class that runs the simulation or builds the bodies. Most paramters are straightforward }{\pageref{classbodygen}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_node}{Node}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_node}{Node}} struct that stores various elements -\/ main important detail is that this \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_node}{Node}} points to eight other node pointers }{\pageref{struct_node}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classregion}{region}} \\*Region class stores boundaries of a region, a vector of bodies in the region, a nodepath and a boolean that checks if collisions have been computed }{\pageref{classregion}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_spacetree}{Spacetree}} \\*A class that basically makes the tree }{\pageref{class_spacetree}}{}
